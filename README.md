# SCC Marketing Organization

I want to create a system for the marketing team to use to keep things organized and on track. We should all be able to pull up info on who is working on what, due dates and current progress. People should also be able to request graphics with an online form, and their request should be added to some kind of queue on the website for assignment to a team member. The requester should also be able to keep tabs on the progress of their request and be notified automatically when it's ready for pickup.

## Users & Needs

### Marketing Team

- Know who's working on what.
- Know when things need to be finished by.
- Know where to find files related to the projects - for reprinting/proofs/etc
- Send an email with attached info to get feedback from whoever needs to give it.

### Requesters

- Have confidence that their request was received.
- Know about delays that may affect the marketing for their events.
